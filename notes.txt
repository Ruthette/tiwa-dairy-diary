bun run build && bun run preview  

bun run preview (or npm run preview): Serves the built (production) 
version of your app, so you see exactly what will be deployed.








In Netlify, go to your site’s
 "Site settings" → "Build & deploy" → 
 "Continuous Deployment". If GitHub is connected,
  you’ll see the repo details and branch 
listed there. If not, it will say manual 
deploy or prompt you to connect a Git provider.









No, you do not need to run bun run build before 
every git push. If you use Netlify’s Git integration,
 Netlify will run the build command for you after each 
 push. You only need to run bun run build locally if
  you are doing a manual deploy (uploading the 
  dist folder yourself).
